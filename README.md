Additional Technical Achievements
* Clouds are created using a function. This function takes an x and y to place the circles. The offset of one circle to another is made up of constants.
* There is an on/off button to change the color of the window square, which simulates a light in the house

Additional Design Achievements
* The shapes are arranged to create a picture
* The "window" can turn on/off, like lights are in a house
* opacity is modified for clouds for enhanced effect
