For this assignment I took inspiration from the things around me and visualized them using many different graphical primitives. I used different colors, styles, and techniques to get the results I wanted. First there is a cat, which is made up of some circles, polygons, lines, and arcs. Then there is a clock, which is a circle with some lines as well as some text. Finally there is a TV which is a rectangle and a couple lines.

For my Technical Achievement I decided to try out some elements that were not part of the requirements. I figured out how to use arcs, which took some additional research, and I also figured out I could use hex values to get specific colors that weren't represented by just names. Also, part of the reason I chose a clock for inspiration was to give myself the challenge of adding text. Overall, I wanted to go above and beyond a simple page of shapes, and create something with a bit more detail and math involved. 

For my Design Achievement, I wanted to challenge myself to recreate things I could see in real life as I did this assignment. I worked off of real references and created something that had more meaning than random shapes on a page. Even though it's all just pixels on a screen that I made with code, I wanted to keep in mind that what I created would be perceived by human eyes. So I made something that is hopefully visually engaging and tells a piece of the story of what is inside of my room.

I started from scratch but I did find this source helpful when trying to figure out SVG shapes and all that: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js/create-svg-elements-in-d3js

And I found out how to do arcs from here: https://d3js.org/d3-shape/arc
