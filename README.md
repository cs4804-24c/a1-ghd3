<h2>Description</h2>
My assignment has 4 shapes with various colors and sizes: an orange rectangle, a pink triangle, a green circle and a black line. Users can interact with the shapes for different animations. To make this program, I just started with the code provided in the original assignment repository and utilized documentation from d3.js to add what I wanted.

<h2>Technical Achievements</h2>
For my technical achievements, I added animations to the shapes upon user interaction. When users click or hover on my shapes, they will do different things like change the color, change the opacity, change the size or location. 

<h2>Design Achievements</h2>
For my design achievements, I not only changed played with colors and stroke linecaps, but also added text to my shapes. The text provides directions for users to utilize my technical achievement.
