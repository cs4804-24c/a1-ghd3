For this assignment I decideded to make a small football field with animation in it as well which are players (circles) moving around to emmulate a kickoff.

This is the tutorial I mainly looked at to get started. This site also had useful info about other things like transformation, transitions, and animation.

I also looke at the following links  to help with things like text, rotation, polygons, strok-width and color.

Technical Acheivement:
For the the technical acheivement I used transitions to create a small animation sequence of a kickoff on the football field. I believe this goes beyond the base requirements and shows a deeper understanding for this assignment.


Design Acheivement:
For the the designment acheivement I used transformations,translations,rotations to create an accurate image of a football field using various diffrerent shapes and colors. I believe this goes beyond the base requirements and shows a deeper understanding for this assignment.
