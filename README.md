## Description:
I used different kinds of graphic primitives to create my drawing of a car moving down a road. I used lines to create
the different components of the road, a rectangle for the bottom half of the car, polygons for the top half of the car
including the windows, and circles for the wheels of the car. I then animated the car to look as though it is moving
down the road. 

Screenshot of the car (will need to open site to view animation):

## Design Achievement: 
For my design achievement, I created a car. Instead of just making a bunch of random shapes, I compiled them in a way 
that would be instantly recognizable by the user. The animation is also instantly recognizable as indicating the car 
moving down the road. By designing my page in this way, I have made the shapes and animations meaningful to the user. 

## Technical Achievement: 
My technical achievement was animating the car. I made the car move vertically across the screen to make it look as 
though the car is moving down the road. I then reset the car position, so it could continue to move down the road 
repeatedly while the page is open.

## Sources: 
- I used https://d3js.org/d3-transition/timing to figure out how to animate the car. 
- I also referenced the demo done by Professor Harrison in class to start my project and get familiar with the design
process.
