## **Description**

**Link:** https://fullstackgoogler.github.io/a1-ghd3/

My site starts off as a blank canvas, where once the user begins left clicking around, random required shapes begin generating. These include:
- Circle
- Rectangle or Square
- Line
- Polygon (ranging from a Triangle to a Dodecagon)

Furthermore, attributes for each generated graphic are also randomized to provide more unique shapes. These attributes include:
- Color
- Opacity
- Orientation
- Size

Users additionally have access to the following features:
- Removing graphics with **Right Click**
- Using **CTRL + S** to automatically save the canvas as a png file

## **Example**

Opening the Site:

## **Technical Achievements**

Aspects that I consider to be technical achievements include:
- Ability to remove graphics by right clicking on them
- Ability to save the page as a .png file

## **Design Achievements**

Aspects that I consider to be design achievements include:
- Amount of variance between shapes of the same type
