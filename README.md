# Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  

## Overview
This project is a screen saver-like program developed using D3.js. It features dynamically animated geometric shapes with gradient colors, along with a real-time digital clockã€‚

## Features
- **Moving Shapes**: Includes a rectangle, a circle, a line, and a polygon, each moving across the screen with a unique gradient.
- **Dynamic Gradients**: Each shape has a linear gradient applied for a visually appealing effect.
- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Implementation details
- **D3.js Framework**: Leverage D3.js for dynamic, interactive web-based graphics.
- **SVG Animation**: Shapes created as SVG elements are animated for continuous movement.
- **Clock function**: Utilize JavaScript's "Date" object and "setInterval" for real-time clock updates.
