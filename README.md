For Assignment 1, I created a adaptive picture of what a city during the day/night. I used circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, and paths to create my picture/art piece. The foundation or container was made with an SVG. Rectangles were added for the buildings and the red AOV light. Cirlces were added for the sun/moon. Lines were added for the building poles. Paths were used to create the curved lines for the bird wings. Polygons, specifically pentagons were added to the top of some buildings to give it different shapes.

Technical Achievement Description:
- I added a function to change the colors of the sun, the background, and the buildings to represent a typical sunny day in the city. This was done through the use of a built in timer.
- I added a function to make the red lights on top of some buildings blink to simulate the Aviation Obstruction Light you would typically see on top of tall buildings. I needed it to blink at a faster pace than the change of the city from morning to night, so I had to use a different time interval.
- I added a function to rotate the wings (lines) that represented a bird. The left wing would go clockwise up, then counterclockwise back down, and the right wing would do the opposite, at the same time intervals. A bounce effect was added to the animation to make the wings flap more naturally. This was meant to simulate the flapping of wings as the birds fly through the city. This also used a sort of timer.

Design Achievement Description:
- I added a creative title - City Summer Evening - for my project so people could immediately understand what the picture and animation is.
- Throughout the assignment I would talk and have discussions with my girlfriend who majors in illustration and does graphic design, on how I could improve the picture and my visualization. Some of these suggestions included:
    - Using saturation and the change of saturation to make the sun change to a moon
    - Using saturation and the change of saturation to make the background turn darker and then lighter to simulated sunset and sunrise
    - Using saturation and the change of saturation to make the buildings change based on the time of day - darker at night and greyish during the day.
    - Using saturation and the change of saturation to make the AOV light look like its blinking.
    - Making the bird's wings curved instead of a straight v shape to make it more realistic.
    - Make the sun/moon larger and put it in the center of the city for aesthetic purposes.
    - Offset the bird (usually traveling in a triangluar formation) for aesthetic purposes and realism.
- I made sure that everything is where I wanted, like making sure the AOV light is perfectly centered on the pole.
- I made sure everything in the picture made sense, and had a sense of realism and would complement each other well.
