Description
---
Here I have made a picture of a house with a backdrop. 
There are rectangles for the pink house, grass, and window
There are circles used for the clouds
There are lines used to make a "bird" in a v shape
A polygon (triangle) was made as a roof

Additional Technical Achievements
* Clouds are created using a function. This function takes an x and y to place the circles. The offset of one circle to another is made up of constants.
* There is an on/off button to change the color of the window square, which simulates a light in the house

Additional Design Achievements
* The shapes are arranged to create a picture
* The "window" can turn on/off, like lights are in a house
