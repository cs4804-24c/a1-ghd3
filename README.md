Description and Screenshots:
I created a 600x600 SVG canvas that has a line grid creating 4 equal parts of the canvas. In the four sections, 
there is either a circle, rectangle, or a polygon in different colors. The rectangle and the 
circle in the upper sections are animated and will swap places.

_Technical:_ I included animations on both cirlces and the rectangle. The orange 
circle swaps places with each other, and the light green circle increases in size. 

_Sources:_ I used this to help with animations
