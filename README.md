Prerequisite 
D3 package and open in browser extension
Usage 
Right click to access the Open in default browser option. The program creates a logo on the browser using primitive shapes such as rectangle, circle, line, polygon and letter. The M letter is created by polygon and line. The line across the logo is rectangle, and the rainbow circle is make of circle

Design
The webpage features a dark backdrop with a background color of #151515. The design incorporates a pleasing color scheme, utilizing pastel shades (#f49595, #ffbd90, #f9eb97, #c6f9ac, #a8d9f6, #e2bbfd) for circles and shapes, creating a visually striking contrast. Elements are strategically positioned on the SVG canvas, fostering a balanced and cohesive composition. The Impact font with an italic style is applied to the text, presenting a bold and distinctive appearance. A letter-spacing of 12px enhances readability and adds a design element to the text. Consistency in color choices and styling contributes to a unified visual experience, while a clear visual hierarchy is established through size and positioning of larger elements like circles and text. The inclusion of lines and polygons adds dynamic and geometric elements, enhancing the overall visual interest of the composition.

Technical
The code not only dynamically creates an SVG container using D3.js for scalability but also ensures responsiveness by setting the viewport meta tag, allowing the visualization to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. Leveraging D3.js, the code efficiently appends circles, rectangles, polygons, lines, and styled text elements with specific attributes, showcasing the versatility of D3.js in handling diverse visual components. The modular approach enables easy customization and extension, contributing to a visually engaging and adaptable design.
