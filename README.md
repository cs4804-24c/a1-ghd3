# Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  

## by Priyanka Narasimhan

I created a web page with lines, circles, rectangles, and polygons that I designed myself using bits of code I found for creating each particular element:

    Polygons:

    Random Color Generation:

I designed it so that every time you press the refresh button you get a new configuration of all of these shapes. Their placement, size, color, and orientation are randomized.

Here are screenshots of the results:

### Technical Achievement Desription:
- was able to use d3 and Javascript to meet the requirements of having an svg, with a rectangle, a circle, a line, and a polygon. 

### Design Achievement Description:
- managed to go beyond expectations by using color, size, and position randomization.
