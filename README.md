Design/Technical Acheivements: I created all the shapes and lines to follow a specfi color pallete of red, orange and yellow. Rather tha doing a a single line, I created a zigzag line that and that in a continuous manner rather than creating a line each direction. The rectangles have rounded eges and have a gradient as the colors to make it look more interesting, which the polygon has as well. The circles have a yellow and outine in maroon. To make the shapes more intersting I created a zigzag pattern which took time to figure out the position of the shapes so that it does not overlap each other.
