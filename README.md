I thought it would be a good challenge to re-make / vectorize an AI generated logo that I've been using as branding for the websites I build. I've been using this png for a while, but it isn't scaleable and, since it's AI generated, the colors / edges are all a little different from each other.

Here's the version I created in D3:

I believe that this is a technically impressive first D3 project! I learned to use linear gradients in D3, how to round the corners of rectangles, use connected paths to make smooth-edged polygons, and then whipped up a little web server to host the project.
