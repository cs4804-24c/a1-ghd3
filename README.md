_description & images:_
I created a 500x500 SVG canvas that contains a line grid separating the canvas into four equal parts. In each part there is 1-2 shapes, either a rectangle, circle, or polygon in varying different colors. Each of the shapes in animated in some way, either by moving, expanding, changing colors, or changing shapes in the case of one of the polygons.

_technical/design achievements:_
technical: I included animations - each of the shapes shown is animated in a different way, and each of the animations is infinitely looped to return to the shape's original state with a delay before transitioning again.
