Description
---
My assignment has lines, polygons, circles and rectangles in different colors and shades. You can interact with some of the shapes such as the square tree, the sun, and the background to make them move or change color. For this project I used d3.js documentation, the code from the original assignement and the ESM+CDN example from d3js.org  the professor used in his demo video.

Technical Achievements
---
I added on click interactions that would change the color of shapes, or rotate  them. Additionally, I added an animation that made it appear the "car" figure was moving across the screen.

Design Achievements
---
For this project, I decided to paint a simple picture. I played with shapes to mock the appearence of trees, a cloud, a sun/moon, grass, a road and a car. I also added a gradient to the sun to help with its appearence. Through user interaction, the image can go from day to night as elements such as the sun can turn into a moon, and the sky blue background can go into night.
