I used this assignment mostly as an opportunity to familiarize myself with how html, javascript, and github all work together. I have done HTML and CSS work in the past, but it was a long time ago, and I did not retain much. I have no experience with graphics stuff, so it took me awhile to understand how a lot of the stuff works, and learn core concepts like SVG containers and how to place stuff where I want it to be. I started by creating a couple of basic shapes, and then I used a line to draw a rectangle from scratch to encompass what I had done. I think I figured out how the alignment works, by basically brute forcing it with a coordinate system. I have read the documentation on the D3js website, and I think there is a much better way to do it then I did, and it is something I will keep looking into as I move forward.
