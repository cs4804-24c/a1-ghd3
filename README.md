I tried to remake the cover of an album I tried seeing. After playing around with different little shapes, I wasn't too sure what I could make. However, the colors really reminded me of a certain album cycle of a group I'm a fan of. The one I remade is called The Story of Light' Epilogue - The 6th Album.
