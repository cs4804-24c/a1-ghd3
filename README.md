Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===


Description
---
My assignment utilizes various shapes and d3 functions to paint a picture of a
sunny summer day from morning to sunset. Circles, lines, rectangles and 
polygons(triangle and hexagon) were achieved using different colors. Clicking some
shapes will also give the user a surprise.

Technical and Design Achievement
---
technical achievement- I was able to add transition and animations to various shapes
such as the yellow circle(sun), the white curved line(wind), and the blue rectangle(sky).
When these shapes are clicked they change shape, add other shapes or change color.

design achievment- I was able to use shapes to design a picture that can be understood
as soon as you look at it. These shapes all use specific colors and were made to represent
a real world object.
